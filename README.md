Antler wants to analyse the various factors and causes associated with absenteism of its employees.
The provided is one year with various attributes associated with its employees.This was part of 
our Capstone project.

### Data Understanding
The data provided is for each employee and none of the leaves mentioned are repeated by same employee.
There are 21 reasons for absence and other attribute showcase age,service time,absence hours,month, 
weekday,distance,no. of children,no. of pets, height , weight of employee etc.

### Data Preparation
Since Month and weekday were numerical columns, so converted them to categorical one. Also created
calculated columns like weight status(normal,overweight,obesity,extreme obese) and workload(high,low,
average). After this tried to connect the relation bewteen various attributes and reason of absence.
Created a Dynamic Dashboard to provide all required information. It has two version, one represents
my own analysis where i have tried to include all the atributes thats somehow is connected with reason 
for absence.The other one represents the queries as it was asked in the given assignment.
